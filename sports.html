          Rated number three globally, basketball is not just an american sport
          like football, but it is played globally. Basketball unlike football,
          has also incorporated the sports as a women's sport, naming it the
          Women's National Basketball Association. Although it has moved equally
          across the world as a man and woman's sport, the pay somehow hasn't
          faired out the same. Women are only paid a fraction of what men are
          paid in this sport citing the biggest inequality. That women are not
          equal to men
